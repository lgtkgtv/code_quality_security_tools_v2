## 🏗️ Educational Framework Design

### Step-by-Step Learning Flow
Each tool follows a consistent 7-step educational process:

1. **Introduction**: What the tool does and why it matters
2. **Problem Examination**: View bad/problematic code examples
3. **Configuration Understanding**: Learn tool options and settings
4. **Tool Execution**: Run tool with explanation of commands
5. **Interactive Review**: Analyze issues one by one with explanations
6. **Fix Demonstration**: Show how to resolve each issue type
7. **Comparison**: Before/after code comparison

### Interactive Features
- **Prompted Learning**: User controls pace with confirmations
- **Code Viewing**: Optional examination of example files
- **Issue-by-Issue Review**: Detailed analysis of each problem
- **Fix Explanations**: Specific guidance for each error type
- **Best Practice Examples**: Multiple code samples showing good patterns

### Safe Learning Environment
- **Preserved Examples**: Original bad code never modified
- **Working Copies**: Tools operate on temporary files
- **Git Ignored**: No risk of committing test files
- **Isolated Execution**: Each tool has its own workspace
